I can bring my three kids and they have lunch  more than they can eat  and a drink. My husband and I order off the lunch menu- a combo with rice and beans and with tax the bill comes to $18.  The problem is the yucky water- so any drink I try... water obviously or iced tea or soda tastes moldy/bad.  The free chips with salsa and bean dip is my favorite part.   Spinach Enchilada- good Chile Relleno- okay Charro Beans- okay Spanish Rice- yucky  though really it has to be awesome for me to like it at all   If I didn't have 3 kids eating free I wouldn't eat here. type review business_id _mt0EQgGCG-qrLy51RnQag
